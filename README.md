machine-learning project that predict life expectancy.
goal is to predict life expectancy,using linear regression.
Project steps:
1)scrapping information from 
https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/
https://worldpopulationreview.com/
https://worldpopulationreview.com/
Makeing one big dataframe to work with it.
2)clean the data from information that not exist delete empty columns and empty rows and replace string numbers to floats
3)EDA make data visualization and see what left from the data and what could contribute to the prediction 
4)Remove outliers from that data make everything ready for the machine learning process
5)define best vectors of the data that have score 0.3 or -0.3 with our vector of life expectancy
6)Predict the vector:)
